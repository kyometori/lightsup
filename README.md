# Lights Up
Light up all the bulbs!

## How to play
There are bulbs, with some of them randomly lighted. When you toggle a bulb, the bulb itself and the adjacent bulbs will all be toggled, turning from on to off or from off to on. Two bulbs are adjacent if they share a common edge. The goal is to light up all bulbs.
